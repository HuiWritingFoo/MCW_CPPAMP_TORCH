# ** C++ AMP backend Implementation for Torch7 ** #

##Introduction: ##

This repository hosts the C++ AMP backend implementation project for  [torch7](http://torch.ch/). Torch7 framework currently has a CUDA backend support in the form of [cutorch](https://github.com/torch/cutorch) and [cunn](https://github.com/torch/cunn) packages. The goal of this project is to develop  gputorch and gpunn packages that would functionally behave as  C++ AMP counterparts for exisiting cutorch and cunn packages. This project mainly targets the linux platform and makes use of the linux-based C++ AMP compiler implementation hosted [here](https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/cppamp-driver-ng/overview)
